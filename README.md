# Membrane voltage fluctuations in human breast cancer cells
This repository contains code for end-to-end analysis and figure creation for the preprint/submitted paper 'Membrane voltage fluctuations in human breast cancer cells' by Peter Quicke, Yilin Sun, Mar Arias-Garcia, Corey D. Acker, Mustafa B. A. Djamgoz, Chris Bakal, and Amanda J. Foust.

The end-to-end analysis and figure plotting is done by running the file make_paper_data/create_paper_data.py. This requirees the original imaging data, which is multiple TB and so will be made available on request to the authors.
